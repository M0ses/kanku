## Welcome to the new project page

The new page is built with [Statocles](http://preaction.me/statocles/).

We decided to switch from plain HTML to a Static Site Generator for the following reasons:

* Make it easier to write content
* Use a framework to maintain a blog
* Make deployment easier and more flexible

but the most important point:

* Generate Changelog, Release notes, etc. out of one source

We will follow up with some blog posts about the the tools we create
to auto-generate these documentationi.

Stay tuned.
